# CoReACTER Pedagogy
Teaching materials developed within the CoReACTER, mainly for courses in the Chemical Engineering department of Carnegie Mellon University

## Requirements

For now, we write our syllabi and course materials using [Typst](https://typst.app/). You can download a local compiler (instructions [here](https://github.com/typst/typst)), or you can use the free-ish online webapp.

We use the [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/) font to improve accessibility. Please download for free from the Braille Institute.
